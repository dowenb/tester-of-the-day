# Opportunities to help support Tester Of The Day!

Thank you for considering volenteering your time to support Tester Of The Day! I really appreciate it, and I am sure the Tester Community will too!

## Instructions

I need help finding Testers to nominate, and getting those nominations in the right format so I can copy and paste them into the right place.
as it takes me time every day to sort it out. (I'm sure I'll make a more elegent system eventually)

### Your first task:

* Find one or more testers to nominate for tester of the day.
* Put the nomination using the templates below for Twitter and JSON
* Send me the filled in templates via Twitter DM or e-mail to ben@dowen.me.uk

### Next steps

Once this process is working well, I will assign people days of the week where they are responsible for choosing the winner.
